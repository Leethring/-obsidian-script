# git branch

For git, `git branch` can check the branch and do extra manipulation for different branches.

``` shell
$ git branch
* main # we are in the main branch
  test
```

## Add branch

`git branch <branch name>` can add a new branch. 

``` shell
$ git branch test # add test branch
$ git branch
* main
  test
```

## Delete branch 

`git branch -d <branch name>` can delete a existed branch

``` shell
$ git branch
* main
  test 
$ git branch -d test # delete test branch
Deleted branch test (was 0517a42)
$ git branch 
* main
```
