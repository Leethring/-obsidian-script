# Type Hint Of Python

The `type hint` give a brief information of an argument or a statement what type it belong to. 

Everything in python is an object, so it's hard to identify the type of an object in use. In the way, the type hint can avoid it when need. 

## Example
``` python
def printHello(name:str) -> str: # -> str: is a type hint describing statement as string
	print("Hello " + name)
```
