# Rehearse

When people **rehearse** a play, dance, or piece of music, they practice it in order to prepare for a performance. 

If you **rehearse** something that you are going to say or do, you silently practice it by imagining that you are saying or doing it. 

If you **rehearse** something, you repeat it in detail. 

> [!example]
> - I can **rehearse** this in your mind, and do a good job on the formal stage.
