# Paper note

#Notes #Inzk 

When we listen to a lesson, or watch video for learning, we take paper notes. 

## Big page

When we take notes at paper, we call two page in one view as `big page`. 

One big page have 4 modules that separates the big page into 4 blocks with same area. 

## Module

The `module` is the minimal unit of a subject. It is 1/4 of a big page. 

## Subject

The `subject` is the minimal unit of a subject differentiated from other subjects. A subject is similar to a new note from inbox. 

To arrange the notes order, we use modudle as minimal unit of a subject. When we want to write a new subject, we should add new module and left the old subject unfilled module blank.  

When a subject reach the end of a module and need a new module to continue, we will give it the nearest unused module. 

## Subject title

Every module. 

Every separated module from same subject has a subject tittle. 

`**`  stand for sub-subject. 

## Archive behaviour

Paper notes is a inbox. A inbox need a archive to deal with useless and completed inbox notes. We mark `X` at the upper right of a page to archive notes on this page, which is the `archive behaviour`. 

## Date

When we take notes on paper, every page has a date. The date show when we take these notes. One page only can have one `date`.
